***********************************************************/
After reading the workshop instruction, prior to start coding, I referred to course notes for guidance on how to approach the problem
by learning from course note and examples that were like problem in workshop. Then when I got familiar with the concept and purpose 
of the workshop, I started to code by following workshop instruction and referring to course notes and previous workshop to find out 
the solution to each problem. I also had some help from internet by watching tutorial on how the c++ lambdas and enumeration works 
and how to prohibit copying, moving and assigning values to an object by setting each method equal to delete keyword. 
I also learnt how to use try and catch method in c++ by following the course example and referring to my course note 
form web322 on using the try and catch method.
